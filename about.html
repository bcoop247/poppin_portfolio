      <p class="about-me-paragraph">Hello, I'm Brandon! I am a dedicated and aspiring Software Engineer. My journey into the world of software development has been an exciting transition from my former employment role as a property and casualty claims adjuster. I am highly motivated to make a career shift and have always been intrigued by technology and its ever-evolving state. I love solving problems and find the scope of coding to be challenging, enjoyable, and highly rewarding. I have a solid understanding of the key fundamental principles of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. I have developed full-stack applications using React as the front end and express JS with PostgreSQL to run the back end. 
        <br><br>
        I'm passionate about crafting clean, efficient code and thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and absorb insights from experienced peers. I'm truly excited to combine my professional background with my newfound coding expertise to create impactful and user-centered software solutions that make a difference.</p>

      <p class="about-me-paragraph">
        I studied Computer Science as a minor at Florida State University with a main focus on Criminology. I was unsure as to what I wanted to do in the long run until I began diving deeper into the world of development. I took a leap of faith and went through a 6-month Software Engineering Bootcamp at the State College of Florida. I found the boot camp to be highly enjoyable and am now focused on learning all aspects of developing software and web applications. In addition to coding, I also enjoy running, golfing, and going to the beach!
